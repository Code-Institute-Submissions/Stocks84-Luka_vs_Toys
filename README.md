# LUKA VS TOYS

The Luka vs Toys (LVT) website is typically aimed for a child aged between 4 & 6 years old, with bespoke elements to that child. These elements can be changed depending on the client. In this instance the client’s child is a 5-year old boy named ‘Luka’. The bespoke elements for this website are a Paper, Rock, Scissors styled game that has been substituted for a Viking, Dino, and the child himself Luka. LVT includes a game for the child, that keeps score against the computer, also gives the child easy access to their favourite interests such as cartoons, music, and football team.

LVT is a simple to use website that can be used on a mobile, tablet, or computer and designed with a child in mind. Please see UX section for more detail for the bespoke design.

## UX

For the design of LVT I had to take account of what the client wanted:
-   Include favourite colours such as Red, Green, Yellow, and Grey.
-   Include the favourite toys, The Viking, The Dino.
-   Make it personal to the child.
-   Add any extra features than just the game.
